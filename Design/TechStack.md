- Vue (Frontend Framework)
  - [Vue Main Page](https://vuejs.org/)
  - Vue is a well respected open source front end framework with a large community of people who use it and very comprehensive docs.  It is lightweight and easy to learn.  Other projects from Accutech use Vue and it was suggested by the team members, so they can take the project from us in the future and build off of it wihtout learning new technology.

- .Net and C#
  - [.Net Homepage](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet)
  - [C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
  - .Net and C# are going to be used for our backend.  They are both very popular with developers and have huge communities of people to learn from and libraries to play with.  Accutech also uses this for thie projects, so we were asked to use this specifically.

- Docker
  - [Docker Homepage](https://www.docker.com/)
  - Docker is going to be our tool used for building, managing, running, and distributing our code.  It will work hand in hand with Git.  Similar to the last two, we were told to use this by Accutech, but it is a really great tool and we would have used it anyways.

- AWS
  - [AWS Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  - AWS was mentioned several times as our cloud solution. Since such a big part of this project is storing and maintaining documents, AWS will serve as our cloud storage system for the clients documents.  This is quickly becoming the most popular DevOps tool and Accutech plans to use it for their other projects.  This will also work with Docker

- BitBucket
  - [BitBucket Homepage](https://bitbucket.org/product)
  - BitBucket is the interface that we will use to interact with Git.  It is effectively the same thing as GitHub and serves the same purpose.  We chose it because Accutech uses it to store their code for all of their development projects.
