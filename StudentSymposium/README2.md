The Judges(we didn't get their names...)

### Landon Hammond
It was a wonderful opportunity to gain experience explaining a project I’ve worked on to someone who doesn’t know about it. Lots of great questions were asked that might have gone over our heads since we are so close to the project all the time. It was also a great chance to catch up on the progress of the other capstone teams and see what we’ve all been up to.

### Peyton Schaefer
I really enjoyed talking to people about the project.  Even with all we have been through, I am very happy with what we have done and am incredibly proud of our software.  I also enjoyed the opportunity to talk to the other capstone groups and see where they are and where they came from, and I especially thought it was cool to compare their experiences with ours.

### Cameron Allan
My experience with the student symposium was very beneficial in challenging myself to articulate the ideas of our project in a clear and concise manner to people of all experiences. It also helped me gain new perspectives and helped with important communication skills that are essential in serving me in my future.

### Nate Slagter
I think that this was a great assignment for us to do. I was a little hesitant orginally, but after getting the poster set up I was pretty excited. The whole thing kind of reminded me of science fair. It was satisfying in the same way; we had worked hard on a project for months, and now we get to show other people what we've been working on, while at the same time getting to learn about what our peers have been up to.
I hope everyone else got as much out of this experience as I did.
