## Things Clarified

- Somehow, there were no visual bugs, and the checklist worked as planned
- Dan mentioned the possibility of having multiple checklists per user in the future
- The contacts page still doesn't have a mobile view

## Client Use of the Project

- Dan's use of this project was really simple, he created an account and then used the checklist.
- He used the product for only a couple of minutes to try the mobile view and try out the checklist.
- He appreciated how simple it was and how easy it all was to follow.
- He appreciated the prompts on the pages and thought it was a nice way to introduce the user to the system.
- Issues:
  - The mobile page wasn't scrolling sometimes
  - The contacts page does not have a mobile view
