## Topics Discussed

- Went over design details of business requirements, use cases, requirements, domain model, and proptotype.
  - The Architecture and Tech Stack were not discussed in detail but were brought up.
- Both Dan and Michael had comments only on the prototype.
  - The buttons should have more dead space in between them.
  - Consider a different system rather than tabs for storing folders, i.e. something akin to Google Drive
  - Change the colors to AccuTech colors.
- Clarified what the Account Aggregation and Assets and Liabilities business requirements are.

## Things Clarified

- AccuTech does have a color theme that they use for most internal tools and software that they provide, so we will be following that going forward with our frontend. 
- The AccuTech development team has created a template project for us to look at to get a better idea of what they are wanting from the product.
  - We will be viewing this in a future meeting date TBD.
- AccuTech guide will be provided soon to ensure the Front End has proper color.
