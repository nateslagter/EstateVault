## Topics Discussed

- Went over plans for the access management one more time to make sure we were on the same page
- Dicussed how the user will actually control the document access from the frontend
- Went over database changes and some refactoring


## Things Clarified

- We will meet again later in the week to work on the project together. Not to discuss, but rather to actually code and use eachother as resources.
- We need to make several new tables to the database, so that will happen soon so that development can start on the new features.

## Tasks Distributed

- Nate: clean up backend and refactor the tests -- also look into mocking AWS services
- Landon: add new document table and insert that change into the document upload and document download routes
- Cameron: continue working on the frontend design and nail down how the user will interact with the new access management system
- Peyton: add invite and connections table and bgin working on a way for users to add eachother to their networks
