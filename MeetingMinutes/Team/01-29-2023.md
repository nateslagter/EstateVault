## Topics Discussed

- Dicussed the invites and connection system
- How the user will interact with these systems?
- How to mock S3 since we are almost costing Nate money


## Things Clarified

- The new tables are not set up in a convenient way, so we need to change those before those features can be implemented
- The figma's for the connection page needs to be done so we can have that running as soon as the backend is set up
- We will likely meet with Dan on Monday February 6th to present the iteration.

## Tasks Distributed

- Nate: continue mocking the S3 service
- Landon: Move towards creating invitations and connections on the backend
- Cameron: continue working on the frontend access control
- Peyton: Finish the figma for the connections screen and create temporary json so the backend can be plugged in as soon as it is done
