Nate
Topics Discussed

    We discussed some last minute changes to the software. We had identified a few bugs while testing it throughout the weekend that needed attention,
    so we coded together to remove the bugs before making the final release for this iteration.

Things Clarified

    We talked about what exactly we wanted to present to Dan tomorrow, and began gathering resources from our project to present to him tomorrow. We also
    discussed the test coverage for our project. We are above the necessary threshold, but we want to try and up the number before the iteration is due.

Tasks Distributed

    Nate: finish creating new backend tests and ensure software is fully deployable for release
    Landon: finish creating new backend tests and ensure that the database has all the necessary parts to be deployed for release
    Cameron: refine the notification sidebar in the frontend
    Peyton: test the frontend and ensure that the comment sy stem is able to be used with no hiccups
