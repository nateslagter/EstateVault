## Topics Discussed

- We ran Michael through the final touches of the last iteration since he was not present for our presentation with Dan
  - Namely, we showed him the new document view and the finalized permissions system
- We showed him the starts of the notifications system and got his input on our ideation
  - He thinks we are going about it in a smart way, and that it fits in line with our system well
- Continued plans for continuous integration and fixing the bitbucket pipeline


## Things Clarified

- Things should be able to be done on multiple pages.  From a document, you should be able to see who its shared with and revoke that access or add new access.  If you can see information on a page, you should be able to interact with it
- We need to have better testing, and Michael gave us some input on how we can accomplish that.
- Michael also stressed the importance of trying every single feature before the demo so we are confident the whole system works fine together.
