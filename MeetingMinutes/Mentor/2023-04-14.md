## Topics Discussed

We showcased to michael the backend implementation of the checklist, discussed our progress with implementing Entity Framework, showed progress made towards full mobile integration of the UI, and discussed how we wanted to go about implementing the checklist into the frontend.

## Things Clarified

Michael provided a bit of feedback regarding the implementation of the checklist, and gave feedback on our current implementation of EF. He had little other feedback for us, and thought that our plans for the frontend implementation of the checklist was good, he mainly thought that we were on the right path with our progress. Most of the feedback included providing resources to ease implementation.
