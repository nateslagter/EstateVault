## Topics Discussed

 We ran Michael through the final touches of the last iteration since he was not present for our presentation with Dan. This mainly consisted
 of showing him the notification system and how it functioned behind the scenes. We also showed him the new comment funcionality, and asked his
 opinoion of what he thought of the site UI.

## Things Clarified

We talked to Michael about how we would begin to twilight the software so that it could be passed onto Accutech in the next month. We also talked to him 
about possible job prospects. He talked to us about his path to AccuTech, and that they are hiring new developers now. Finaly, we talked about finally
getting continuous integration set up with the project.
