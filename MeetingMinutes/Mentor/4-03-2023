## Topics Discussed

We discussed with Michael our plans for this iteration and what he should expect of us to have accomplished by the time of our next meeting.
We discussed that we plan on implementing the checklist system for each user, and received feedback from him on our ideas of implementation. 
We discussed that we plan on ironing out all the kinks in our UI and UX in terms of adding more error handling, adjusting the UI of different parts of the application. As well as ensuring we implement all needed UX for the demographic we are expecting to use our system.

## Things Clarified

We clarified with Michael our ideas on the checklist system, as well as clarified that we plan on using this iteration to get things wrapped up, and ensure the system is as polished as it can be.
